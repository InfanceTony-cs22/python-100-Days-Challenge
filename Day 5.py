# The following 5 lines assign strings to a list of variables.
salutation = "Dr."
first_name = "Prisha"
middle_name = "Jai"
last_name = "Agarwal"
suffix = "Ph.D."
 
print(salutation + " " + first_name + " " + middle_name + " " + last_name + ", " + suffix) 
# The comma as a string ", " adds the conventional use of a comma plus a 
# space to separate the last name from the suffix.
 
# Alternatively, you could use commas in place of the + connector:
print(salutation, first_name, middle_name, last_name,",", suffix)
# However, you will find that this produces a space before a comma within a string.




numerator = 7
denominator = 5   # Possible resolution: Change the denominator value 
result = numerator / denominator
print(result)
 
# One possible assumption for a number divided by zero error might
# include the issue of a null value as a denominator (could happen when
# using a loop to iterate over values in a database). In such cases, the
# desired outcome may be to leave the numerator value intact. The
# numerator value can be preserved by reassigning the denominator with 
# the integer value of 1. The result would then equal the numerator



#print("5 * 3 = " + (5*3)) 
 
# Resolution: 
print("5 * 3 = " + str(5*3))
#
# To avoid a type error between the string and the integer within the
# print() function, you can make an explicit data type conversion by
# using the str() function to convert the integer to a string.
